    "explanation": "When a user encrypts plaintext with PGP, PGP first compresses the plaintext. The session key works with a very secure, fast conventional encryption algorithm to encrypt the plaintext; the result is ciphertext. Once the data is encrypted, the session key is then encrypted to the recipient's public key\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\n\nPretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.\n\nPGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a username or an e-mail address.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\n\nPublic key encryption uses two different keys. One key is used to encrypt the information and the other is used to decrypt the information. Sometimes this is referred to as asymmetric encryption because two keys are required to make the system and/or process work securely. One key is known as the public key and should be shared by the owner with anyone who will be securely communicating with the key owner. However, the owner’s secret key is not to be shared and considered a private key. If the private key is shared with unauthorized recipients, the encryption mechanisms protecting the information must be considered compromised.",

    "explanation": "There is no single, standardized classification of cross-site scripting flaws, but most experts distinguish between at least two primary flavors of XSS flaws: non-persistent and persistent. In this issue, we consider the non-persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability.\nThe non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site scripting vulnerability is by far the most basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the content.\n\nBecause HTML documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be redisplayed verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for. If this response does not properly escape or reject HTML control characters, a cross-site scripting flaw will ensue.",

    "E": "",
    "F": "",
    "G": "",
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "The SSID (service set identifier) is the name of your wireless network. SSID broadcast is how your router transmits this name to surrounding devices. Its primary function is to make your network visible and easily accessible. Most routers broadcast their SSIDs automatically. To disable or enable SSID broadcast, you need to change your router’s settings.\n\nDisabling SSID broadcast will make your Wi-FI network name invisible to other users. However, this only hides the name, not the network itself. You cannot disguise the router's activity, so hackers can still attack it.\n\nWith your network invisible to wireless devices, connecting becomes a bit more complicated. Just giving a Wi-FI password to your guests is no longer enough. They have to configure their settings manually by including the network name, security mode, and other relevant info.\n\nDisabling SSID might be a small step towards online security, but by no means should it be your final one. Before considering it as a security measure, consider the following aspects:\n\n- Disabling SSID broadcast will not hide your network completely\n\nDisabling SSID broadcast only hides the network name, not the fact that it exists. Your router constantly transmits so-called beacon frames to announce the presence of a wireless network. They contain essential information about the network and help the device connect.\n\n- Third-party software can easily trace a hidden network\n\nPrograms such as NetStumbler or Kismet can easily locate hidden networks. You can try using them yourself to see how easy it is to find available networks – hidden or not.\n\n- You might attract unwanted attention.\n\nDisabling your SSID broadcast could also raise suspicion. Most of us assume that when somebody hides something, they have a reason to do so. Thus, some hackers might be attracted to your network.",

Unfortunately, the membersof management do not want to have to use such long complicated \r\npasswords so they tell Harold's boss this new password policy should not apply to them. To comply with the management's wishes, the IT department creates another Windows domain and moves all the management users to that domain. This new domain has a password policy only requiring 8 characters.\r\nHarold is concerned about having to accommodate the managers, but cannot do anything about it. Harold is also concerned about using LanManager security on his network instead of NTLM or NTLMv2, but the many legacy applications on the network prevent using the more secure NTLM and NTLMv2. Harold pulls the SAM files from the DC's on the original domain and the new domain using Pwdump6. Harold uses the password cracking software John the Ripper to crack users' passwords to make sure they are strong enough. Harold expects that the users' passwords in the original domain will take much longer to crack than the management's passwords in the new domain. After running the software, Harold discovers that the 14 character passwords only took a short time longer to crack than the 8 character passwords.\r\nWhy did the 14 character passwords not take much longer to crack than the 8 character passwords?",

    "explanation": "Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data to provide secure encrypted communication between two computers over an Internet Protocol network. It is used in virtual private networks (VPNs).\n\nIPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of a session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host). IPsec uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It supports network-level peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection.\n\nThe initial IPv4 suite was developed with few security provisions. As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or internet layer end-to-end security scheme. In contrast, while some other Internet security systems in widespread use operate above layer 3, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) that operates at the Transport Layer and Secure Shell (SSH) that operates at the Application layer, IPsec can automatically secure applications at the IP layer.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec",

    "explanation": "Server-side request forgery (also called SSRF) is a net security vulnerability that allows an assaulter to induce the server-side application to make http requests to associate arbitrary domain of the attacker’s choosing.\n\nIn typical SSRF examples, the attacker might cause the server to make a connection back to itself, or to other web-based services among the organization’s infrastructure, or to external third-party systems.\n\nAnother type of trust relationship that often arises with server-side request forgery is where the application server is able to interact with different back-end systems that aren’t directly reachable by users. These systems typically have non-routable private informatics addresses. Since the back-end systems normally ordinarily protected by the topology, they typically have a weaker security posture. In several cases, internal back-end systems contain sensitive functionality that may be accessed while not authentication by anyone who is able to act with the systems.\n\nIn the preceding example, suppose there’s an body interface at the back-end url https://192.168.0.68/admin. Here, an attacker will exploit the SSRF vulnerability to access the executive interface by submitting the following request:\n\nPOST /product/stock HTTP/1.0\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 118\nstockApi=http://192.168.0.68/admin",

Unwitting web users could also be invited to log into the attacker’s server, prompting them to enter sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

The attacker is additionally ready to hook up with other networks related to the users’ credentials.Fake access points are found out by configuring a wireless card to act as an access point (known as HostAP). they’re hard to trace since they will be shut off instantly. The counterfeit access point could also be given an equivalent SSID and BSSID as a close-by Wi-Fi network. The evil twin are often configured to pass Internet traffic through to the legitimate access point while monitoring the victim’s connection, or it can simply say the system is temporarily unavailable after obtaining a username and password.",

    "explanation": "In this attack KRACK is an acronym for Key Reinstallation Attack. KRACK may be a severe replay attack on Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol (WPA2), which secures your Wi-Fi connection. Hackers use KRACK to take advantage of a vulnerability in WPA2. When in close range of a possible victim, attackers can access and skim encrypted data using KRACK.\n\nHow KRACK WorksYour Wi-Fi client uses a four-way handshake when attempting to attach to a protected network. The handshake confirms that both the client — your smartphone, laptop, et cetera — and therefore the access point share the right credentials, usually a password for the network. This establishes the Pairwise passkey (PMK), which allows for encoding .Overall, this handshake procedure allows for quick logins and connections and sets up a replacement encryption key with each connection. this is often what keeps data secure on Wi-Fi connections, and every one protected Wi-Fi connections use the four-way handshake for security. This protocol is that the reason users are encouraged to use private or credential-protected Wi-Fi instead of public connections.KRACK affects the third step of the handshake, allowing the attacker to control and replay the WPA2 encryption key to trick it into installing a key already in use. When the key’s reinstalled, other parameters related to it — the incremental transmit packet number called the nonce and therefore the replay counter — are set to their original values.Rather than move to the fourth step within the four-way handshake, nonce resets still replay transmissions of the third step. This sets up the encryption protocol for attack, and counting on how the attackers replay the third-step transmissions, they will take down Wi-Fi security.\n\nWhy KRACK may be a ThreatThink of all the devices you employ that believe Wi-Fi. it isn’t almost laptops and smartphones; numerous smart devices now structure the web of Things (IoT). due to the vulnerability in WPA2, everything connected to Wi-Fi is in danger of being hacked or hijacked.Attackers using KRACK can gain access to usernames and passwords also as data stored on devices. Hackers can read emails and consider photos of transmitted data then use that information to blackmail users or sell it on the Dark Web.Theft of stored data requires more steps, like an HTTP content injection to load malware into the system. Hackers could conceivably take hold of any device used thereon Wi-Fi connection. Because the attacks require hackers to be on the brink of the target, these internet security threats could also cause physical security threats.On the opposite hand, the necessity to be in close proximity is that the only excellent news associated with KRACK, as meaning a widespread attack would be extremely difficult.Victims are specifically targeted. However, there are concerns that a experienced attacker could develop the talents to use HTTP content injection to load malware onto websites to make a more widespread affect.\n\nEveryone is in danger from KRACK vulnerability. Patches are available for Windows and iOS devices, but a released patch for Android devices is currently in question (November 2017). There are issues with the discharge , and lots of question if all versions and devices are covered.The real problem is with routers and IoT devices. These devices aren’t updated as regularly as computer operating systems, and for several devices, security flaws got to be addressed on the manufacturing side. New devices should address KRACK, but the devices you have already got in your home probably aren’t protected.\n\nThe best protection against KRACK is to make sure any device connected to Wi-Fi is patched and updated with the newest firmware. that has checking together with your router’s manufacturer periodically to ascertain if patches are available.\n\nThe safest connection option may be a private VPN, especially when publicly spaces. If you would like a VPN for private use, avoid free options, as they need their own security problems and there’ll even be issues with HTTPs. Use a paid service offered by a trusted vendor like Kaspersky. Also, more modern networks use WPA3 for better security.Avoid using public Wi-Fi, albeit it’s password protection. That password is out there to almost anyone, which reduces the safety level considerably.All the widespread implications of KRACK and therefore the WPA2 vulnerability aren’t yet clear. what’s certain is that everybody who uses Wi-Fi is in danger and wishes to require precautions to guard their data and devices.",

    "explanation": "Triple DES is another mode of DES operation. It takes three 64-bit keys, for an overall key length of 192 bits. In Stealth, you merely type within the entire 192-bit (24 character) key instead of entering each of the three keys individually. The Triple DES DLL then breaks the user-provided key into three subkeys, padding the keys if necessary in order that they are each 64 bits long. The procedure for encryption is strictly an equivalent as regular DES, but it’s repeated 3 times , hence the name Triple DES. the info is encrypted with the primary key, decrypted with the second key, and eventually encrypted again with the third key.Triple DES runs 3 times slower than DES, but is far safer if used properly. The procedure for decrypting something is that the same because the procedure for encryption, except it’s executed in reverse. Like DES, data is encrypted and decrypted in 64-bit chunks. Although the input key for DES is 64 bits long, the particular key employed by DES is merely 56 bits long . the smallest amount significant (right-most) bit in each byte may be a parity , and will be set in order that there are always an odd number of 1s in every byte. These parity bits are ignored, so only the seven most vital bits of every byte are used, leading to a key length of 56 bits. this suggests that the effective key strength for Triple DES is really 168 bits because each of the three keys contains 8 parity bits that aren’t used during the encryption process.Triple DES ModesTriple ECB (Electronic Code Book)• This variant of Triple DES works precisely the same way because the ECB mode of DES.• this is often the foremost commonly used mode of operation.Triple CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)• This method is extremely almost like the quality DES CBC mode.• like Triple ECB, the effective key length is 168 bits and keys are utilized in an equivalent manner, as described above, but the chaining features of CBC mode also are employed.• the primary 64-bit key acts because the Initialization Vector to DES.• Triple ECB is then executed for one 64-bit block of plaintext.• The resulting ciphertext is then XORed with subsequent plaintext block to be encrypted, and therefore the procedure is repeated.• This method adds an additional layer of security to Triple DES and is therefore safer than Triple ECB, although it’s not used as widely as Triple ECB.",

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Twofish is an encryption algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier. It’s a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits, with keys up to 256 bits. it’s associated with AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and an earlier block cipher called Blowfish. Twofish was actually a finalist to become the industry standard for encryption, but was ultimately beaten out by the present AES.Twofish has some distinctive features that set it aside from most other cryptographic protocols. For one, it uses pre-computed, key-dependent S-boxes. An\nS-box (substitution-box) may be a basic component of any symmetric key algorithm which performs substitution. within the context of Twofish’s block cipher, the S-box works to obscure the connection of the key to the ciphertext. Twofish uses a pre-computed, key-dependent S-box which suggests that the S-box is already provided, but depends on the cipher key to decrypt the knowledge.\n\nHow Secure is Twofish?Twofish is seen as a really secure option as far as encryption protocols go. one among the explanations that it wasn’t selected because the advanced encryption standard is thanks to its slower speed. Any encryption standard that uses a 128-bit or higher key, is theoretically safe from brute force attacks.\nTwofish is during this category.Because Twofish uses “pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes”, it are often susceptible to side channel attacks. this is often thanks to the tables being pre-computed. However, making these tables key-dependent helps mitigate that risk. There are a couple of attacks on Twofish, but consistent with its creator, Bruce Schneier, it didn’t constitute a real cryptanalysis. These attacks didn’t constitue a practical break within the cipher.\n\nProducts That Use TwofishGnuPG: GnuPG may be a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC4880 (also referred to as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data and communications; it features a flexible key management system, along side access modules for all types of public key directories.KeePass: KeePass may be a password management tool that generates passwords with top-notch security. It’s a free, open source, lightweight and easy-to-use password manager with many extensions and plugins.Password Safe: Password Safe uses one master password to stay all of your passwords protected, almost like the functionality of most of the password managers on this list. It allows you to store all of your passwords during a single password database, or multiple databases for various purposes. Creating a database is straightforward , just create the database, set your master password.PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): PGP is employed mostly for email encryption, it encrypts the content of the e-mail . However, Pretty Good Privacy doesn’t encrypt the topic and sender of the e-mail , so make certain to never put sensitive information in these fields when using PGP.TrueCrypt: TrueCrypt may be a software program that encrypts and protects files on your devices. With TrueCrypt the encryption is transparent to the user and is completed locally at the user’s computer. this suggests you’ll store a TrueCrypt file on a server and TrueCrypt will encrypt that file before it’s sent over the network.",

It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7.\nIts best-known sub-project is the open-source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.\nThe Metasploit Project includes anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is pre-installed in the Kali Linux operating system.\n\nThe basic steps for exploiting a system using the Framework include.\n1. Optionally checking whether the intended target system is vulnerable to an exploit.\n2. Choosing and configuring an exploit (code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its bugs; about 900 different exploits for Windows, Unix/Linux and macOS systems are included).\n3. Choosing and configuring a payload (code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry; for instance, a remote shell or a VNC server). Metasploit often recommends a payload that should work.\n4. Choosing the encoding technique so that hexadecimal opcodes known as \"bad characters\" are removed from the payload, these characters will cause the exploit to fail.\n5. Executing the exploit.\n\nThis modular approach – allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload – is the major advantage of the Framework. It facilitates the tasks of attackers, exploit writers and payload writers.",

    "question": "Joseph was the Web site administrator for the Mason Insurance in New York, who's main Web site was located at www.masonins.com. Joseph uses his laptop computer regularly to administer the Web site. One night, Joseph received an urgent phone call from his friend, Smith. According to Smith, the main Mason Insurance web site had been vandalized! All of its normal content was removed and replaced with an attacker's message ''Hacker Message: You are dead! Freaks!” From his office, which was directly connected to Mason Insurance's internal network, Joseph surfed to the Web site using his laptop. In his browser, the Web site looked completely intact.\n\nNo changes were apparent. Joseph called a friend of his at his home to help troubleshoot the problem. The Web site appeared defaced when his friend visited using his DSL connection. So, while Smith and his friend could see the defaced page, Joseph saw the intact Mason Insurance web site. To help make sense of this problem, Joseph decided to access the Web site using hisdial-up ISP. He disconnected his laptop from the corporate internal network and used his modem to dial up the same ISP used by Smith. After his modem connected, he quickly typed www.masonins.com in his browser to reveal the following web page: (ảnh)\n\nAfter seeing the defaced Web site, he disconnected his dial-up line, reconnected to the internal network, and used Secure Shell (SSH) to log in directly to the Web server. He ran Tripwire against the entire Web site, and determined that every system file and all the Web content on the server were intact. How did the attacker accomplish this hack?\n",

    "explanation": "We have various articles already in our documentation for setting up SNMPv2 trap handling in Opsview,\nbut SNMPv3 traps are a whole new ballgame. They can be quite confusing and complicated to set up the first time you go through the process, but when you understand what is going on, everything should make more sense.\n\nSNMP has gone through several revisions to improve performance and security (version 1, 2c and 3). By default, it is a UDP port based protocol where communication is based on a ‘fire and forget’ methodology in which network packets are sent to another device, but there is no check for receipt of that packet (versus TCP port when a network packet must be acknowledged by the other end of the communication link).\n\nThere are two modes of operation with SNMP – get requests (or polling) where one device requests information from an SNMP enabled device on a regular basis (normally using UDP port 161), and traps where the SNMP enabled device sends a message to another device when an event occurs (normally using UDP port 162). The latter includes instances such as someone logging on, the device powering up or down, or a wide variety of other problems that would need this type of investigation.\n\nThis blog covers SNMPv3 traps, as polling and version 2c traps are covered elsewhere in our documentation.\n\nSNMP trapsSince SNMP is primarily a UDP port based system, traps may be ‘lost’ when sending between devices; the sending device does not wait to see if the receiver got the trap. This means if the configuration on the sending device is wrong (using the wrong receiver IP address or port) or the receiver isn’t listening for traps or rejecting them out of hand due to misconfiguration, the sender will never know.\n\nThe SNMP v2c specification introduced the idea of splitting traps into two types; the original ‘hope it gets there’ trap and the newer ‘INFORM’ traps. Upon receipt of an INFORM, the receiver must send an acknowledgement back. If the sender doesn’t get the acknowledgement back, then it knows there is an existing problem and can log it for sysadmins to find when they interrogate the device.",

An example of a Quid Pro Quo is a scammer pretending to be an IT support technician. The con artist asks for the login credentials of the company’s computer saying that the company is going to receive technical support in return. Once the victim has provided the credentials, the scammer now has control over the company’s computer and may possibly load malware or steal personal information that can be a motive to commit identity theft.\n\n\"A quid pro quo attack (aka something for something” attack) is a variant of baiting.

Ignorant these attacks, the users are redirected to malicious websites, which results in insensitive and personal data being leaked. It is a method of attack where your DNS server is tricked into saving a fake DNS entry. This will make the DNS server recall a fake site for you, thereby posing a threat to vital information stored on your server or computer.\n\nThe cache poisoning codes are often found in URLs sent through spam emails. These emails are sent to prompt users to click on the URL, which infects their computer. When the computer is poisoned, it will divert you to a fake IP address that looks like a real thing. This way, the threats are injected into your systems as well.\n\nDifferent Stages of Attack of DNS Cache Poisoning:\n- The attacker proceeds to send DNS queries to the DNS resolver, which forwards the Root/TLD authoritative DNS server request and awaits an answer.\n\n- The attacker overloads the DNS with poisoned responses that contain several IP addresses of the malicious website. To be accepted by the DNS resolver, the attacker's response should match a port number and the query ID field before the DNS response. Also, the attackers can force its response to increasing their chance of success.\n\n- If you are a legitimate user who queries this DNS resolver, you will get a poisoned response from the cache, and you will be automatically redirected to the malicious website",

    "explanation": "PKI uses public-key cryptography, which is widely used on the Internet to encrypt messages or authenticate message senders. In public-key cryptography, a CA generates public and private keys with the same algorithm simultaneously. The private key is held only by the subject (user, company, or system) mentioned in the certificate, while the public key is made publicly available in a directory that all parties can access. The subject keeps the private key secret and uses it to decrypt the text encrypted by someone else using the corresponding public key (available in a public directory). Thus, others encrypt messages for the user with the user's public key, and the user decrypts it with his/her private key.",

It's the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, but it offers far more inherent security. A digital signature is intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications.\n\nDigital signatures can provide evidence of origin, identity, and status of electronic documents, transactions, or digital messages. Signers can also use them to acknowledge informed consent.\n\nDigital signatures are based on public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Two keys are generated using a public key algorithm, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), creating a mathematically linked pair of keys, one private and one public.\n\nDigital signatures work through public-key cryptography's two mutually authenticating cryptographic keys. The individual who creates the digital signature uses a private key to encrypt signature-related data, while the only way to decrypt that data is with the signer's public key.",

Index crossing or Path Traversal is a HTTP assault which permits aggressors to get to limited catalogs and execute orders outside of the web worker’s root registry.\nWeb workers give two primary degrees of security instruments \n- Access Control Lists (ACLs)\n- Root index\n\nAn Access Control List is utilized in the approval cycle. It is a rundown which the web worker’s manager uses to show which clients or gatherings can get to, change or execute specific records on the worker, just as other access rights.\n\nThe root registry is a particular index on the worker record framework in which the clients are kept. Clients can’t get to anything over this root.\n\nFor instance: the default root registry of IIS on Windows is C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot and with this arrangement, a client doesn’t approach C:\\Windows yet approaches C:\\Inetpub\\wwwroot\\news and some other indexes and documents under the root catalog (given that the client is confirmed by means of the ACLs).\n\nThe root index keeps clients from getting to any documents on the worker, for example, C:\\WINDOWS/system32/win.ini on Windows stages and the/and so on/passwd record on Linux/UNIX stages.\n\nThis weakness can exist either in the web worker programming itself or in the web application code.\n\nTo play out a registry crossing assault, all an assailant requires is an internet browser and some information on where to aimlessly discover any default documents and registries on the framework.\n\nWhat an assailant can do if your site is defenselessWith a framework defenseless against index crossing, an aggressor can utilize this weakness to venture out of the root catalog and access different pieces of the record framework. This may enable the assailant to see confined documents, which could give the aggressor more data needed to additional trade off the framework.\n\nContingent upon how the site access is set up, the aggressor will execute orders by mimicking himself as the client which is related with “the site”. Along these lines everything relies upon what the site client has been offered admittance to in the framework.\n\nIllustration of a Directory Traversal assault by means of web application codeIn web applications with dynamic pages, input is generally gotten from programs through GET or POST solicitation techniques. Here is an illustration of a HTTP GET demand URL\n\nGET\n\nhttp://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=oldarchive.html HTTP/1.1 Host: test.webarticles.com\nWith this URL, the browser requests the dynamic page show.asp from the server and with it also sends the parameter view with the value of oldarchive.html. When this request is executed on the web server, show.asp retrieves the file oldarchive.html from the server’s file system, renders it and then sends it back to the browser which displays it to the user. The attacker would assume that show.asp can retrieve files from the file system and sends the following custom URL.\n\nGET\n\nhttp://test.webarticles.com/show.asp?view=../../../../../Windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1\nHost: test.webarticles.com\nThis will cause the dynamic page to retrieve the file system.ini from the file system and display it to the user. The expression ../ instructs the system to go one directory up which is commonly used as an operating system directive. The attacker has to guess how many directories he has to go up to find the Windows folder on the system, but this is easily done by trial and error.\n\nExample of a Directory Traversal attack via web serverApart from vulnerabilities in the code, even the web server itself can be open to directory traversal attacks. The problem can either be incorporated into the web server software or inside some sample script files left available on the server.\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in the latest versions of web server software, but there are web servers online which are still using older versions of IIS and Apache which might be open to directory traversal attacks. Even though you might be using a web server software version that has fixed this vulnerability, you might still have some sensitive default script directories exposed which are well known to hackers.\n\nFor example, a URL request which makes use of the scripts directory of IIS to traverse directories and execute a command can be\n\nGET\n\nhttp://server.com/scripts/..%5c../Windows/System32/cmd.exe?/c+dir+c:\\ HTTP/1.1 Host: server.com\nThe request would return to the user a list of all files in the C:\\ directory by executing the cmd.exe command shell file and run the command dir c:\\ in the shell. The %5c expression that is in the URL request is a web server escape code which is used to represent normal characters. In this case %5c represents the character \\.\n\nNewer versions of modern web server software check for these escape codes and do not let them through. Some older versions however, do not filter out these codes in the root directory enforcer and will let the attackers execute such commands.\n",

    "question": "Joseph was the Web site administrator for the Mason Insurance in New York, who's main Web site was located at www.masonins.com. Joseph uses his laptop computer regularly to administer the Web site. One night, Joseph received an urgent phone call from his friend, Smith. According to Smith, the main Mason Insurance web site had been vandalized! All of its normal content was removed and replaced with an attacker's message ''Hacker Message: You are dead! Freaks!\" From his office, which was directly connected to Mason Insurance's internal network, Joseph surfed to the Web site using his laptop. In his browser, the Web site looked completely intact. No changes were apparent. Joseph called a friend of his at his home to help troubleshoot the problem. The Web site appeared defaced when his friend visited using his DSL connection. So, while Smith and his friend could see the defaced page, Joseph saw the intact Mason Insurance web site. To help make sense of this problem, Joseph decided to access the Web site using hisdial-up ISP. He disconnected his laptop from the corporate internal network and used his modem to dial up the same ISP used by Smith. After his modem connected, he quickly typed www.masonins.com in his browser to reveal the following web page:H@cker Mess@ge:Y0u @re De@d! Fre@ks!After seeing the defaced Web site, he disconnected his dial-up line, reconnected to the internal network, and used Secure Shell (SSH) to log in directly to the Web server. He ran Tripwire against the entire Web site, and determined that every system file and all the Web content on the server were intact. How did the attacker accomplish this hack?",

    "explanation": "Triage is that the initial post-detection incident response method any responder can execute to open an event or false positive. Structuring an efficient and correct triage method can reduce analyst fatigue, reduce time to reply to and right incidents, and ensure that solely valid alerts are promoted to “investigation or incident” status.\n\nEvery part of the triage method should be performed with urgency, as each second counts once in the inside of\na crisis. However, triage responders face the intense challenge of filtering an unwieldy input supply into a condensed trickle of events. Here are some suggestions for expediting analysis before knowledge is validated:\n\n- Organization: reduce redundant analysis by developing a workflow that may assign tasks to responders. Avoid sharing an email box or email alias between multiple responders. Instead use a workflow tool, like those in security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions, to assign tasks.\nImplement a method to re-assign or reject tasks that are out of scope for triage.\n\n- Correlation: Use a tool like a security info and even management (SIEM) to mix similar events. Link potentially connected events into one useful event.\n\n- Data Enrichment: automate common queries your responders perform daily, like reverse DNS lookups, threat intelligence lookups, and IP/domain mapping. Add this knowledge to the event record or make it simply accessible.\n\nMoving full speed ahead is that the thanks to get through the initial sorting method however a a lot of detailed, measured approach is necessary throughout event verification. Presenting a robust case to be accurately evaluated by your security operations center (SOC) or cyber incident response team (CIRT) analysts is key.\nHere are many tips for the verification:\n\n- Adjacent Data: Check the data adjacent to the event. for example, if an end has a virus signature hit, look to visualize if there’s proof the virus is running before career for more response metrics.\n\n- Intelligence Review: understand the context around the intelligence. simply because an ip address was flagged as a part of a botnet last week doesn’t mean it still is an element of a botnet today.\n\n- Initial Priority: Align with operational incident priorities and classify incidents appropriately. ensure the right level of effort is applied to every incident.\n\n- Cross Analysis: look for and analyze potentially shared keys, like science addresses or domain names, across multiple knowledge sources for higher knowledge acurity.",

This can cause users to unwittingly download malware, visit malicious web pages, provide credentials or sensitive information, transfer money, or purchase products online.\n\nTypically, clickjacking is performed by displaying an invisible page or HTML element, inside an iframe, on top of the page the user sees. The user believes they are clicking the visible page but in fact they are clicking an invisible element in the additional page transposed on top of it.",

    "explanation": "Developed by Robert “RSnake” Hansen, Slowloris is DDoS attack software that permits one computer to require down an internet server. Due the straightforward yet elegant nature of this attack, it requires minimal bandwidth to implement and affects the target server’s web server only, with almost no side effects on other services and ports.Slowloris has proven highly-effective against many popular sorts of web server software, including Apache 1.x and 2.x.Over the years, Slowloris has been credited with variety of high-profile server takedowns. Notably, it had been used extensively by Iranian ‘hackivists’ following the 2009 Iranian presidential election to attack Iranian government internet sites .Slowloris works by opening multiple connections to the targeted web server and keeping them open as long as possible. It does this by continuously sending partial HTTP requests, none of which are ever completed. The attacked servers open more and connections open, expecting each of the attack requests to be completed.Periodically, the Slowloris sends subsequent HTTP headers for every request, but never actually completes the request. Ultimately, the targeted server’s maximum concurrent connection pool is filled, and extra (legitimate) connection attempts are denied.By sending partial, as against malformed, packets, Slowloris can easily elapse traditional Intrusion Detection systems.Named after a kind of slow-moving Asian primate, Slowloris really does win the race by moving slowly and steadily. A Slowloris attack must await sockets to be released by legitimate requests before consuming them one by one.For a high-volume internet site , this will take a while . the method are often further slowed if legitimate sessions are reinitiated. But within the end, if the attack is unmitigated, Slowloris—like the tortoise—wins the race.If undetected or unmitigated, Slowloris attacks also can last for long periods of your time . When attacked sockets outing , Slowloris simply reinitiates the connections, continuing to reach the online server until mitigated.Designed for stealth also as efficacy, Slowloris are often modified to send different host headers within the event that a virtual host is targeted, and logs are stored separately for every virtual host.More importantly, within the course of an attack, Slowloris are often set to suppress log file creation. this suggests the attack can catch unmonitored servers off-guard, with none red flags appearing in log file entries.Methods of mitigationImperva’s security services are enabled by reverse proxy technology, used for inspection of all incoming requests on their thanks to the clients’ servers.Imperva’s secured proxy won’t forward any partial connection requests—rendering all Slowloris DDoS attack attempts completely and utterly useless.",

In this technique, the victim is an insider who possesses critical information about the\ntarget organization.\nBaiting is a technique in which attackers offer end users something alluring in exchange for important information such as login details and other sensitive data. This technique relies on the curiosity and greed of the end-users. Attackers perform this technique by leaving a physical device such as a USB flash drive containing malicious files in locations where people can easily find them, such as parking lots, elevators, and bathrooms. This physical device is labeled with a legitimate company's logo, thereby tricking end-users into trusting it and opening it on their systems. Once the victim connects and opens the device, a malicious file downloads. It infects the system and allows the attacker to take control.\nFor example, an attacker leaves some bait in the form of a USB drive in the elevator with the label \"Employee Salary Information 2019\" and a legitimate company's logo. Out of curiosity and greed, the victim picks up the device and opens it up on their system, which downloads the bait. Once the bait is downloaded, a piece of malicious software installs on the victim's system, giving the attacker access.",

    "explanation": "Watering hole is a computer attack strategy, in which the victim is a particular group (organization, industry, or region). In this attack, the attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often uses and infects one or more of them with malware. Eventually, some member of the targeted group gets infected.[1][2][3] The malware used in these attacks typically collects information on the user. Hacks looking for specific information may only attack users coming from a specific IP address. This also makes the hacks harder to detect and research.[4] The name is derived from predators in the natural world, who wait for an opportunity to attack their prey near watering holes.",
