There are four types of risk mitigation strategies that hold unique to Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. When mitigating risk, it’s important to develop a strategy that closely relates to and matches your company’s profile.\nA picture containing diagram Description automatically generated (ảnh)\n\nRisk Acceptance\nRisk acceptance does not reduce any effects; however, it is still considered a strategy. This strategy is a common option when the cost of other risk management options such as avoidance or limitation may outweigh\nthe cost of the risk itself. A companyUthDatEdoMesYn’-t wPaEntNtoTspEenSdTa lWot oIfTmHonKeVyAUoLnAIavDLoIiUdNinMUg PXrisks that do not have a high possibility of occurring will use the risk acceptance strategy.\n\nRisk Avoidance\nRisk avoidance is the opposite of risk acceptance. It is the action that avoids any exposure to the risk whatsoever. It’s important to note that risk avoidance is usually the most expensive of all risk mitigation options.\n\nRisk Limitation\nRisk limitation is the most common risk management strategy used by businesses. This strategy limits a company’s exposure by taking some action. It is a strategy employing a bit of risk acceptance and a bit of risk avoidance or an average of both. An example of risk limitation would be a company accepting that a disk drive may fail and avoiding a long period of failure by having backups.\n\nRisk Transference\nRisk transference is the involvement of handing risk off to a willing third party. For example, numerous companies outsource certain operations such as customer service, payroll services, etc. This can be beneficial for a company if a transferred risk is not a core competency of that company. It can also be used so a company can focus more on its core competencies.",

        "explanation": "(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS)\nRemote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service.\nRADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication.\nA RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows.\n\nAuthentication and authorization\nThe user or machine sends a request to a Network Access Server (NAS) to gain access to a particular network resource using access credentials. The credentials are passed to the NAS device via the link-layer protocol—for example, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) in the case of many dialup or DSL providers or posted in an HTTPS secure web form.\nIn turn, the NAS sends a RADIUS Access Request message to the RADIUS server, requesting authorization to grant access via the RADIUS protocol.\nThis request includes access credentials, typically in the form of username and password or security certificate provided by the user. Additionally, the request may contain other information which the NAS knows about the user, such as its network address or phone number, and information regarding the user's physical point of attachment to the NAS.\nThe RADIUS server checks that the information is correct using authentication schemes such as PAP, CHAP or EAP. The user's proof of identification is verified, along with, optionally, other information related to the request, such as the user's network address or phone number, account status, and specific network service access privileges. Historically, RADIUS servers checked the user's information against a locally stored flat-file database. Modern RADIUS servers can do this or can refer to external sources—commonly SQL, Kerberos, LDAP, or Active Directory servers—to verify the user's credentials.\n\nShape Description automatically generated with medium confidence\n1) Access-Reject,\n2) Access-Challenge,\n3) Access-Accept.\n\nAccess-Reject\nThe user is unconditionally denied access to all requested network resources. Reasons may include failure to provide proof of identification or an unknown or inactive user account.\n\nAccess-Challenge\nRequests additional information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token, or card.\nAccess-Challenge is also used in more complex authentication dialogs where a secure tunnel is established between the user machine and the Radius Server in a way that the access credentials are hidden from the NAS.\n\nAccess-Accept\nThe user is granted access. Once the user is authenticated, the RADIUS server will often check that the user is authorized to use the network service requested. A given user may be allowed to use a company's wireless network, but not its VPN service, for example. Again, this information may be stored locally on the RADIUS server or may be looked up in an external source such as LDAP or Active Directory.",

        "explanation": "   https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf\n\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.\n\nCSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim’s behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user’s session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a legitimate request sent by the victim.\n\nCSRF attacks target functionality that causes a state change on the server, such as changing the victim’s email address or password, or purchasing something. Forcing the victim to retrieve data doesn’t benefit an attacker because the attacker doesn’t receive the response, the victim does. As such, CSRF attacks target\nstate-changing requests.\n\nIt’s sometimes possible to store the CSRF attack on the vulnerable site itself. Such vulnerabilities are called “stored CSRF flaws”. This can be accomplished by simply storing an IMG or IFRAME tag in a field that accepts HTML, or by a more complex cross-site scripting attack. If the attack can store a CSRF attack in the site, the severity of the attack is amplified. In particular, the likelihood is increased because the victim is more likely to view the page containing the attack than some random page on the Internet. The likelihood is also increased because the victim is sure to be authenticated to the site already.",

        "explanation": "The idle scan could be a communications protocol port scan technique that consists of causing spoofed packets to a pc to seek out out what services square measure obtainable. this can be accomplished by impersonating another pc whose network traffic is extremely slow or nonexistent (that is, not transmission or receiving information). this might be associate idle pc, known as a “zombie”.\n\nThis action are often done through common code network utilities like nmap and hping. The attack involves causing solid packets to a particular machine target in an attempt to seek out distinct characteristics of another zombie machine. The attack is refined as a result of there’s no interaction between the offender pc and also the target: the offender interacts solely with the “zombie” pc.\n\nThis exploit functions with 2 functions, as a port scanner and a clerk of sure informatics relationships between machines. The target system interacts with the “zombie” pc and distinction in behavior are often discovered mistreatment totally different|completely different “zombies” with proof of various privileges granted by the target to different computers.\nThe overall intention behind the idle scan is to “check the port standing whereas remaining utterly invisible to the targeted host.\"\nThe first step in execution associate idle scan is to seek out associate applicable zombie. It must assign informatics ID packets incrementally on a worldwide (rather than per-host it communicates with) basis. It ought to be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic can raise its informatics ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the offender and also the zombie, and between the zombie and also the target, the quicker the scan can proceed.\n\nNote that once a port is open, IPIDs increment by a pair of. Following is that the sequence:\n\noffender to focus on -> SYN, target to zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to focus on -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\n\ncurrently offender tries to probe zombie for result. offender to Zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to offender\n-> RST (IPID increment by 1)\n\nSo, during this method IPID increments by a pair of finally.\n\nWhen associate idle scan is tried, tools (for example nmap) tests the projected zombie and reports any issues with it. If one does not work, attempt another. Enough net hosts square measure vulnerable that zombie candidates are not exhausting to seek out. a standard approach is to easily execute a ping sweep of some network. selecting a network close to your supply address, or close to the target, produces higher results. you’ll be able to attempt associate idle scan mistreatment every obtainable host from the ping sweep results till you discover one that works. As usual, it’s best to raise permission before mistreatment someone’s machines for surprising functions like idle scanning.\n\nSimple network devices typically create nice zombies as a result of {they square measure|they’re} normally each underused (idle) and designed with straightforward network stacks that are susceptible to informatics ID traffic detection.\n\nWhile distinguishing an acceptable zombie takes some initial work, you’ll be able to keep re-using the nice ones. as an alternative, there are some analysis on utilizing unplanned public internet services as zombie hosts to perform similar idle scans. leverage the approach a number of these services perform departing connections upon user submissions will function some quite poor’s man idle scanning.",

        "explanation": "Bug bounty programs allow independent security researchers to report bugs to an companies and receive rewards or compensation. These bugs area unit sometimes security exploits and vulnerabilities, although they will additionally embody method problems, hardware flaws, and so on.\n\nThe reports area unit usually created through a program travel by associate degree freelance third party (like Bugcrowd or HackerOne). The companies can got wind of (and run) a program curated to the organization’s wants.\n\nPrograms is also non-public (invite-only) wherever reports area unit unbroken confidential to the organization or public (where anyone will sign in and join). they will happen over a collection timeframe or with without stopping date (though the second possibility is a lot of common).\n\nWho uses bug bounty programs?Many major organizations use bug bounties as an area of their security program, together with AOL, Android, Apple, Digital Ocean, and goldman Sachs. you’ll read an inventory of all the programs offered by major bug bounty suppliers, Bugcrowd and HackerOne, at these links.\n\nWhy do corporations use bug bounty programs?Bug bounty programs provide corporations the flexibility to harness an outsized cluster of hackers so as to seek out bugs in their code.\n\nThis gives them access to a bigger variety of hackers or testers than they’d be able to access on a one-on-one basis. It {can also|also will|can even|may also|may} increase the probabilities that bugs area unit found and reported to them before malicious hackers can exploit them.\n\nIt may also be an honest publicity alternative for a firm. As bug bounties became a lot of common, having a bug bounty program will signal to the general public and even regulators that a corporation incorporates a mature security program.\n\nThis trend is likely to continue, as some have began to see bug bounty programs as an business normal that all companies ought to invest in.\n\nWhy do researchers and hackers participate in bug bounty programs?Finding and news bugs via a bug bounty program may end up in each money bonuses and recognition. In some cases, it will be a good thanks to show real-world expertise once you are looking for employment, or will even facilitate introduce you to parents on the protection team within an companies.\n\nThis can be full time income for a few of us, income to supplement employment, or the way to point out off your skills and find a full time job.\n\nIt may also be fun! it is a nice (legal) probability to check out your skills against huge companies and government agencies.\n\nWhat area unit the disadvantages of a bug bounty program for independent researchers and hackers?A lot of hackers participate in these varieties of programs, and it will be tough to form a major quantity of cash on the platform.\n\nIn order to say the reward, the hacker has to be the primary person to submit the bug to the program. meaning that in apply, you may pay weeks searching for a bug to use, solely to be the person to report it and build no cash.\n\nRoughly ninety seven of participants on major bug bounty platforms haven’t sold-out a bug.\n\nIn fact, a 2019 report from HackerOne confirmed that out of quite three hundred,000 registered users, solely around two.5% received a bounty in their time on the platform.\n\nEssentially, most hackers are not creating a lot of cash on these platforms, and really few square measure creating enough to switch a full time wage (plus they do not have advantages like vacation days, insurance, and retirement planning).\n\nWhat square measure the disadvantages of bug bounty programs for organizations?These programs square measure solely helpful if the program ends up in the companies realizeing issues that they weren’t able to find themselves (and if they’ll fix those problems)!\n\nIf the companies is not mature enough to be able to quickly rectify known problems, a bug bounty program is not the right alternative for his or her companies.\n\nAlso, any bug bounty program is probably going to draw in an outsized range of submissions, several of which can not be high-quality submissions. a corporation must be ready to cope with the exaggerated volume of alerts, and also the risk of a coffee signal to noise magnitude relation (essentially that it’s probably that they’re going to receive quite few unhelpful reports for each useful report).\n\nAdditionally, if the program does not attract enough participants (or participants with the incorrect talent set, and so participants are not able to establish any bugs), the program is not useful for the companies.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of bug bounty participants consider web site vulnerabilities (72%, per HackerOn), whereas solely a number of (3.5%) value more highly to seek for package vulnerabilities.\n\nThis is probably because of the actual fact that hacking in operation systems (like network hardware and memory) needs a big quantity of extremely specialised experience. this implies that firms may even see vital come on investment for bug bounties on websites, and not for alternative applications, notably those that need specialised experience.\n\nThis conjointly implies that organizations which require to look at AN application or web site among a selected time-frame may not need to rely on a bug bounty as there is no guarantee of once or if they receive reports.\n\nFinally, it are often probably risky to permit freelance researchers to try to penetrate your network. this could end in public speech act of bugs, inflicting name harm within the limelight (which could end in individuals not eager to purchase the organizations’ product or service), or speech act of bugs to additional malicious third parties, United Nations agency may use this data to focus on the organization.",

Structuring an efficient and correct triage method can reduce analyst fatigue, reduce time to reply to and right incidents, and ensure that solely valid alerts are promoted to “investigation or incident” status.\n\nEvery part of the triage method should be performed with urgency, as each second counts once in the inside of\na crisis. However, triage responders face the intense challenge of filtering an unwieldy input supply into a condensed trickle of events. Here are some suggestions for expediting analysis before knowledge is validated:\n\n- Organization: reduce redundant analysis by developing a workflow that may assign tasks to responders. Avoid sharing an email box or email alias between multiple responders. Instead use a workflow tool, like those in security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) solutions, to assign tasks.\nImplement a method to re-assign or reject tasks that are out of scope for triage.\n\n- Correlation: Use a tool like a security info and even management (SIEM) to mix similar events. Link potentially connected events into one useful event.\n\n- Data Enrichment: automate common queries your responders perform daily, like reverse DNS lookups, threat intelligence lookups, and IP/domain mapping. Add this knowledge to the event record or make it simply accessible.\n\nMoving full speed ahead is that the thanks to get through the initial sorting method however a a lot of detailed, measured approach is necessary throughout event verification. Presenting a robust case to be accurately evaluated by your security operations center (SOC) or cyber incident response team (CIRT) analysts is key.\nHere are many tips for the verification:\n\n- Adjacent Data: Check the data adjacent to the event. for example, if an end has a virus signature hit, look to visualize if there’s proof the virus is running before career for more response metrics.\n\n- Intelligence Review: understand the context around the intelligence. simply because an ip address was flagged as a part of a botnet last week doesn’t mean it still is an element of a botnet today.\n\n- Initial Priority: Align with operational incident priorities and classify incidents appropriately. ensure the right level of effort is applied to every incident.\n\n- Cross Analysis: look for and analyze potentially shared keys, like science addresses or domain names, across multiple knowledge sources for higher knowledge acurity.",

Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time additional safeguards were developed to protect a user's password against being read from the system. A salt is one of those methods.\n\nA new salt is randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication without keeping and therefore risking exposure of the plaintext password in the event that the authentication data store is compromised.\n\nSalts defend against a pre-computed hash attack, e.g. rainbow tables. Since salts do not have to be memorized by humans they can make the size of the hash table required for a successful attack prohibitively large without placing a burden on the users. Since salts are different in each case, they also protect commonly used passwords, or those users who use the same password on several sites, by making all salted hash instances for the same password different from each other.",

        "explanation": "This question shows a classic example of an IDOR vulnerability. Rob substitutes Ned's name in the \"name\" parameter and if the developer has not fixed this vulnerability, then Rob will gain access to Ned's account. Below you will find more detailed information about IDOR vulnerability.\n\nInsecure direct object references (IDOR) are a cybersecurity issue that occurs when a web application developer uses an identifier for direct access to an internal implementation object but provides no additional access control and/or authorization checks. For example, an IDOR vulnerability would happen if the URL of a transaction could be changed through client-side user input to show unauthorized data of another transaction.\n\nMost web applications use simple IDs to reference objects. For example, a user in a database will usually be referred to via the user ID. The same user ID is the primary key to the database column containing user information and is generated automatically. The database key generation algorithm is very simple: it usually uses the next available integer. The same database ID generation mechanisms are used for all other types of database records.\n\nThe approach described above is legitimate but not recommended because it could enable the attacker to enumerate all users. If it’s necessary to maintain this approach, the developer must at least make absolutely sure that more than just a reference is needed to access resources. For example, let’s say that the web application displays transaction details using the following URL:\nhttps://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74656\n\nA malicious hacker could try to substitute the id parameter value 74656 with other similar values, for example:\nhttps://www.example.com/transaction.php?id=74657\n\nThe 74657 transaction could be a valid transaction belonging to another user. The malicious hacker should not be authorized to see it. However, if the developer made an error, the attacker would see this transaction and hence we would have an insecure direct object reference vulnerability.",

        "explanation": "When a user encrypts plaintext with PGP, PGP first compresses the plaintext. The session key works with a very secure, fast conventional encryption algorithm to encrypt the plaintext; the result is ciphertext. Once the data is encrypted, the session key is then encrypted to the recipient's public key\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\n\nPretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.\n\nPGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a username or an e-mail address.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\n\nPublic key encryption uses two different keys. One key is used to encrypt the information and the other is used to decrypt the information. Sometimes this is referred to as asymmetric encryption because two keys are required to make the system and/or process work securely. One key is known as the public key and should be shared by the owner with anyone who will be securely communicating with the key owner. However, the owner’s secret key is not to be shared and considered a private key. If the private key is shared with unauthorized recipients, the encryption mechanisms protecting the information must be considered compromised.",

After it manages to urge into the now-infected machine a stealth viruses hides itself by continually renaming and moving itself round the disc.Like other viruses, a stealth virus can take hold of the many parts of one’s PC. When taking control of the PC and performing tasks, antivirus programs can detect it, but a stealth virus sees that coming and can rename then copy itself to a special drive or area on the disc, before the antivirus software. Once moved and renamed a stealth virus will usually replace the detected ‘infected’ file with a clean file that doesn’t trigger anti-virus detection. It’s a never-ending game of cat and mouse.The intelligent architecture of this sort of virus about guarantees it’s impossible to completely rid oneself of it once infected. One would need to completely wipe the pc and rebuild it from scratch to completely eradicate the presence of a stealth virus. Using regularly-updated antivirus software can reduce risk, but, as we all know, antivirus software is additionally caught in an endless cycle of finding new threats and protecting against them.\n\nhttps://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-a-stealth-virus/",

A mirror site has its own URL, but is otherwise just like the principal site. Load-balancing devices allow high-volume sites to scale easily, dividing the work between multiple mirror sites.A mirror site is typically updated frequently to make sure it reflects the contents of the first site. In some cases, the first site may arrange for a mirror site at a bigger location with a better speed connection and, perhaps, a better proximity to an outsized audience.If the first site generates an excessive amount of traffic, a mirror site can ensure better availability of the web site or files. For websites that provide copies or updates of widely used software, a mirror site allows the location to handle larger demands and enables the downloaded files to arrive more quickly. Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and other companies have mirror sites from which their browser software are often downloaded.Mirror sites are wont to make site access faster when the first site could also be geographically distant from those accessing it. A mirrored web server is usually located on a special continent from the principal site, allowing users on the brink of the mirror site to urge faster and more reliable access.Mirroring an internet site also can be done to make sure that information are often made available to places where access could also be unreliable or censored. In 2013, when Chinese authorities blocked access to foreign media outlets just like the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, site mirroring was wont to restore access and circumvent government censorship.",

        "explanation": "In this attack KRACK is an acronym for Key Reinstallation Attack. KRACK may be a severe replay attack on Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol (WPA2), which secures your Wi-Fi connection. Hackers use KRACK to take advantage of a vulnerability in WPA2. When in close range of a possible victim, attackers can access and skim encrypted data using KRACK.\n\nHow KRACK WorksYour Wi-Fi client uses a four-way handshake when attempting to attach to a protected network. The handshake confirms that both the client — your smartphone, laptop, et cetera — and therefore the access point share the right credentials, usually a password for the network. This establishes the Pairwise passkey (PMK), which allows for encoding .Overall, this handshake procedure allows for quick logins and connections and sets up a replacement encryption key with each connection. this is often what keeps data secure on Wi-Fi connections, and every one protected Wi-Fi connections use the four-way handshake for security. This protocol is that the reason users are encouraged to use private or credential-protected Wi-Fi instead of public connections.KRACK affects the third step of the handshake, allowing the attacker to control and replay the WPA2 encryption key to trick it into installing a key already in use. When the key’s reinstalled, other parameters related to it — the incremental transmit packet number called the nonce and therefore the replay counter — are set to their original values.Rather than move to the fourth step within the four-way handshake, nonce resets still replay transmissions of the third step. This sets up the encryption protocol for attack, and counting on how the attackers replay the third-step transmissions, they will take down Wi-Fi security.\n\nWhy KRACK may be a ThreatThink of all the devices you employ that believe Wi-Fi. it isn’t almost laptops and smartphones; numerous smart devices now structure the web of Things (IoT). due to the vulnerability in WPA2, everything connected to Wi-Fi is in danger of being hacked or hijacked.Attackers using KRACK can gain access to usernames and passwords also as data stored on devices. Hackers can read emails and consider photos of transmitted data then use that information to blackmail users or sell it on the Dark Web.Theft of stored data requires more steps, like an HTTP content injection to load malware into the system. Hackers could conceivably take hold of any device used thereon Wi-Fi connection. Because the attacks require hackers to be on the brink of the target, these internet security threats could also cause physical security threats.On the opposite hand, the necessity to be in close proximity is that the only excellent news associated with KRACK, as meaning a widespread attack would be extremely difficult.Victims are specifically targeted. However, there are concerns that a experienced attacker could develop the talents to use HTTP content injection to load malware onto websites to make a more widespread affect.\n\nEveryone is in danger from KRACK vulnerability. Patches are available for Windows and iOS devices, but a released patch for Android devices is currently in question (November 2017). There are issues with the discharge , and lots of question if all versions and devices are covered.The real problem is with routers and IoT devices. These devices aren’t updated as regularly as computer operating systems, and for several devices, security flaws got to be addressed on the manufacturing side. New devices should address KRACK, but the devices you have already got in your home probably aren’t protected.\n\nThe best protection against KRACK is to make sure any device connected to Wi-Fi is patched and updated with the newest firmware. that has checking together with your router’s manufacturer periodically to ascertain if patches are available.\n\nThe safest connection option may be a private VPN, especially when publicly spaces. If you would like a VPN for private use, avoid free options, as they need their own security problems and there’ll even be issues with HTTPs. Use a paid service offered by a trusted vendor like Kaspersky. Also, more modern networks use WPA3 for better security.Avoid using public Wi-Fi, albeit it’s password protection. That password is out there to almost anyone, which reduces the safety level considerably.All the widespread implications of KRACK and therefore the WPA2 vulnerability aren’t yet clear. what’s certain is that everybody who uses Wi-Fi is in danger and wishes to require precautions to guard their data and devices.",

        "explanation": "A honeypot may be a trap that an IT pro lays for a malicious hacker, hoping that they will interact with it during a way that gives useful intelligence. It’s one among the oldest security measures in IT, but beware: luring hackers onto your network, even on an isolated system, are often a dangerous game.honeypot may be a good starting place: “A honeypot may be a computer or computing system intended to mimic likely targets of cyberattacks.” Often a honeypot are going to be deliberately configured with known vulnerabilities in situation to form a more tempting or obvious target for attackers. A honeypot won’t contain production data or participate in legitimate traffic on your network — that’s how you’ll tell anything happening within it’s a results of an attack. If someone’s stopping by, they’re up to no good.That definition covers a various array of systems, from bare-bones virtual machines that only offer a couple of vulnerable systems to ornately constructed fake networks spanning multiple servers. and therefore the goals of these who build honeypots can vary widely also , starting from defense thorough to academic research. additionally , there’s now an entire marketing category of deception technology that, while not meeting the strict definition of a honeypot, is certainly within the same family. But we’ll get thereto during a moment.honeypots aim to permit close analysis of how hackers do their dirty work. The team controlling the honeypot can watch the techniques hackers use to infiltrate systems, escalate privileges, and otherwise run amok through target networks. These sorts of honeypots are found out by security companies, academics, and government agencies looking to look at the threat landscape. Their creators could also be curious about learning what kind of attacks are out there, getting details on how specific sorts of attacks work, or maybe trying to lure a specific hackers within the hopes of tracing the attack back to its source. These systems are often inbuilt fully isolated lab environments, which ensures that any breaches don’t end in non-honeypot machines falling prey to attacks.Production honeypots, on the opposite hand, are usually deployed in proximity to some organization’s production infrastructure, though measures are taken to isolate it the maximum amount as possible. These honeypots often serve both as bait to distract hackers who could also be trying to interrupt into that organization’s network, keeping them faraway from valuable data or services; they will also function a canary within the coalpit , indicating that attacks are underway and are a minimum of partially succeeding.",

It is owned by Boston, Massachusetts-based security company Rapid7.\nIts best-known sub-project is the open-source Metasploit Framework, a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. Other important sub-projects include the Opcode Database, shellcode archive and related research.\nThe Metasploit Project includes anti-forensic and evasion tools, some of which are built into the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is pre-installed in the Kali Linux operating system.\n\nThe basic steps for exploiting a system using the Framework include.\n1. Optionally checking whether the intended target system is vulnerable to an exploit.\n2. Choosing and configuring an exploit (code that enters a target system by taking advantage of one of its bugs; about 900 different exploits for Windows, Unix/Linux and macOS systems are included).\n3. Choosing and configuring a payload (code that will be executed on the target system upon successful entry; for instance, a remote shell or a VNC server). Metasploit often recommends a payload that should work.\n4. Choosing the encoding technique so that hexadecimal opcodes known as \"bad characters\" are removed from the payload, these characters will cause the exploit to fail.\n5. Executing the exploit.\n\nThis modular approach – allowing the combination of any exploit with any payload – is the major advantage of the Framework. It facilitates the tasks of attackers, exploit writers and payload writers.",

These addresses are commonly used for local area networks (LANs) in residential, office, and enterprise environments.\n\nPrivate network addresses are not allocated to any specific organization. Anyone may use these addresses without approval from regional or local Internet registries. Private IP address spaces were originally defined to assist in delaying IPv4 address exhaustion. IP packets originating from or addressed to a private IP address cannot be routed through the public Internet.\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has directed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to reserve the following IPv4 address ranges for private networks:\n\n• 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255\n\n• 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255\n\n• 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255\n\nBackbone routers do not allow packets from or to internal IP addresses. That is, intranet machines, if no measures are taken, are isolated from the Internet. However, several technologies allow such machines to connect to the Internet.\n\n• Mediation servers like IRC, Usenet, SMTP and Proxy server\n\n• Network address translation (NAT)\n\n• Tunneling protocol\n\nNOTE: So, the problem is just one of these technologies.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network",

        "explanation": "An evil twin may be a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that appears to be legitimate but is about up to pay attention to wireless communications.[1] The evil twin is that the wireless LAN equivalent of the phishing scam.This type of attack could also be wont to steal the passwords of unsuspecting users, either by monitoring their connections or by phishing, which involves fixing a fraudulent internet site and luring people there.The attacker snoops on Internet traffic employing a bogus wireless access point. Unwitting web users could also be invited to log into the attacker’s server, prompting them to enter sensitive information like usernames and passwords. Often, users are unaware they need been duped until well after the incident has occurred.When users log into unsecured (non-HTTPS) bank or e-mail accounts, the attacker intercepts the transaction, since it’s sent through their equipment. The attacker is additionally ready to hook up with other networks related to the users’ credentials.Fake access points are found out by configuring a wireless card to act as an access point (known as HostAP). they’re hard to trace since they will be shut off instantly. The counterfeit access point could also be given an equivalent SSID and BSSID as a close-by Wi-Fi network. The evil twin are often configured to pass Internet traffic through to the legitimate access point while monitoring the victim’s connection, or it can simply say the system is temporarily unavailable after obtaining a username and password.",

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "The SSID (service set identifier) is the name of your wireless network. SSID broadcast is how your router transmits this name to surrounding devices. Its primary function is to make your network visible and easily accessible. Most routers broadcast their SSIDs automatically. To disable or enable SSID broadcast, you need to change your router’s settings.\n\nDisabling SSID broadcast will make your Wi-FI network name invisible to other users. However, this only hides the name, not the network itself. You cannot disguise the router's activity, so hackers can still attack it.\n\nWith your network invisible to wireless devices, connecting becomes a bit more complicated. Just giving a Wi-FI password to your guests is no longer enough. They have to configure their settings manually by including the network name, security mode, and other relevant info.\n\nDisabling SSID might be a small step towards online security, but by no means should it be your final one. Before considering it as a security measure, consider the following aspects:\n\n- Disabling SSID broadcast will not hide your network completely\n\nDisabling SSID broadcast only hides the network name, not the fact that it exists. Your router constantly transmits so-called beacon frames to announce the presence of a wireless network. They contain essential information about the network and help the device connect.\n\n- Third-party software can easily trace a hidden network\n\nPrograms such as NetStumbler or Kismet can easily locate hidden networks. You can try using them yourself to see how easy it is to find available networks – hidden or not.\n\n- You might attract unwanted attention.\n\nDisabling your SSID broadcast could also raise suspicion. Most of us assume that when somebody hides something, they have a reason to do so. Thus, some hackers might be attracted to your network.",

        "explanation": "An evil twin attack is a hack attack in which a hacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi network that looks like a legitimate access point to steal victims’ sensitive details. Most often, the victims of such attacks are ordinary people like you and me.\n\nThe attack can be performed as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The fake Wi-Fi access point is used to eavesdrop on users and steal their login credentials or other sensitive information. Because the hacker owns the equipment being used, the victim will have no idea that the hacker might be intercepting things like bank transactions.\n\nAn evil twin access point can also be used in a phishing scam. In this type of attack, victims will connect to the evil twin and will be lured to a phishing site. It will prompt them to enter their sensitive data, such as their login details. These, of course, will be sent straight to the hacker. Once the hacker gets them, they might simply disconnect the victim and show that the server is temporarily unavailable.\n\nADDITION: It may not seem obvious what happened. The problem is in the question statement. The attackers were not Alice and John, who were able to connect to the network without a password, but on the contrary, they were attacked and forced to connect to a fake network, and not to the real network belonging to Jane.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_twin_(wireless_networks)",
